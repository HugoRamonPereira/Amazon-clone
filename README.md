# Amazon Clone

This is the Amazon Clone - A massive e-commerce project that was built using [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [Javascript](https://www.ecma-international.org/), it also uses [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) to make this application look exactly like the real Amazon website, [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com) to manage Google Authentication, [Stripe](https://stripe.com/en-br) to manage payments through the web and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org) to manage the state of our application so we can keep track of the changes of our application and have full control over it.

This amazon replica lists a lot of products that come from an API called [fakestoreapi](https://fakestoreapi.com), where the user, clients can see the products, their prices and ratings, as well as add or remove the products from the cart and later on they can use Stripe to pay for the products they want.
